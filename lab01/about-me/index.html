            <p> My name is Ethan and I am a computer science student from Alberta. I have a passion for programming and
                software engineering and have been working on projects since I was a young age. My skills include web
                development, mobile development, and software engineering. I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, Python, and Java. I am also an experienced Linux user and have experience with various Linux
                distributions and tools. In addition to my programming skills, I also have a strong understanding of
                databases and networking. I am always eager to learn new technologies and strive to stay up to date with
                the ever-changing tech landscape. I am a hard worker and take great pride in my work.</p>
