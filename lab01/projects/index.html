                    <h2 class="project-text">I made Google by first creating a search engine that would compile data
                        from
                        individual websites andpresent it to users in an easy-to-navigate format. I then built a
                        powerful
                        algorithm that would analyze the content of each website and determine which websites were most
                        relevant to the query. This algorithm would also determine the order in which the results were
                        presented. I then combined the search engine with an advertising system, so that companies could
                        promote their websites and products. Finally, I added features like news, videos, images, and
                        maps,
                        to make Google a one-stop shop for all your information needs.</h2>

                    <h2 class="project-text">I created Facebook in 2004 while I was a student at NAIT. I had the idea of
                        creating a social network where people could share information, photos, and engage in
                        conversations
                        with each other. To make this idea a reality, I wrote the code for a website and launched it on
                        February 4, 2004. Initially, I only allowed Harvard students to join, but quickly expanded the
                        user
                        base to other schools in the Boston area. Later, I opened up Facebook to anyone over the age of
                        13
                        with a valid email address. Since then, Facebook has grown to become one of the most popular
                        social
                        networks in the world, with over 2.5 billion monthly active users.</h2>
